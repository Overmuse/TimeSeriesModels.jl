# TimeSeriesModels.jl
`TimeSeriesModels.jl` is a julia library for working with time-series models of the `ARIMA` and `GARCH` families. We currently support:

## Conditional mean models:
- Zero-mean
- Constant-mean
- AR
- MA
- ARMA
- GARCH-in-mean

## Conditional variance models:
- Constant-variance
- ARCH
- GARCH
